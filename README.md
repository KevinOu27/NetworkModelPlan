Restaurant Recommendation System Project
This repository contains the source code, project plan, and documentation for a restaurant recommendation system designed for over 100 restaurants in Marlborough, Massachusetts. The system leverages Yelp review data to provide users with personalized recommendations, built with a modern tech stack and optimized for scalability.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to develop a consumer-focused restaurant recommendation system that integrates with real-time Yelp reviews to offer personalized suggestions. The system will feature a responsive frontend, a scalable backend, and a robust recommendation algorithm powered by real-world data.

Repository Structure
/backend: Contains the backend code, written in Go, with a GraphQL API and PostgreSQL for persistent storage.
/frontend: The frontend code, developed using Alpine.js and TailwindCSS.
/project-planning: Contains the project plan, task breakdown, Gantt charts, and linear programming optimization scripts.
/docs: Documentation, including the project proposal and the methods/results write-up.
Key Components
Backend: Go-based backend with GraphQL for real-time data integration and data processing.
Frontend: Alpine.js and TailwindCSS provide a lightweight and responsive user interface.
Database: PostgreSQL for persistent storage, ensuring scalability and performance.
Data Integration: Yelp GraphQL API for obtaining real-time restaurant reviews and updates.
Deliverables
1. Project Proposal
The proposal outlines the requirements for the recommendation system, including technical specifications, milestones, and resource allocation. It also describes the team structure and the overall project timeline.

2. Implementation
Backend development: Implemented in Go, focusing on scalability and real-time data handling.
Frontend development: Developed using Alpine.js and TailwindCSS to ensure a modern, responsive interface.
Database setup: PostgreSQL for handling restaurant and review data.
3. Project Plan
A detailed project plan using linear programming techniques to optimize the timeline. Gantt charts for the best-case, expected-case, and worst-case scenarios are included.

4. Documentation
The methods and results sections describe the approach taken for project scheduling, resource allocation, and critical path analysis. This section also outlines the system architecture and key decision points throughout the development process.
